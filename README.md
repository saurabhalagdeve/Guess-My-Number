Description
This is a simple number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player's objective is to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of the player's score and highscore.
